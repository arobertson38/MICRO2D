            Data science, machine learning, and deep learning techniques have 
            been used to make tremendous advances in a wide variety of challenging 
            problems over the last decade. However, these advances are overwhelmingly 
            clustered in domains where the needed training datasets could be readily 
            curated (e.g., natural language processing, computer vision, 
            recommendation systems, translation, etc.). Capitalization on these 
            transformative techniques in the sciences and engineering has been 
            bottlenecked by the expense of curating training data. This is 
            especially true in Materials Informatics where the number of different 
            possibilities -- combinations of material chemistries, microstructures, 
            and processing pathways -- is overwhelming and the cost of collecting 
            data is tremendous.

            We present <b>MICRO2D</b> to support the continued growth of 
            big data efforts in Materials Informatics. <b>MICRO2D</b>
            is a statistically diverse, big heterogeneous microstructure dataset 
            composed of 87,379 2-phase microstructures. The dataset contains 
            microstructures displaying a wide diversity of 2-point statistics 
            and local neighborhood distributions. The dataset also contains 
            mechanical (elastic) and thermal properties computed over a range 
            of constituent property pairs for the two phases. 42 computed 
            homogenized properties are included in total. Additionally, elastic 
            strain fields are provided for a few select boundary conditions 
            and constituent properties. Additional localized fields are available 
            upon request, but are not included due to memory constraints. The 
            dataset is hosted permanently on the following google drive.

        <h3> Dataset Contents and Structure </h3>

        <p class="styled_text">
        The MICRO2D dataset is composed of 87,379 2-phase microstructures. We refer
        the interested reader to the first paper listed above -- "MICRO2D: A Large,
        Statistically Diverse, Heterogeneous Microstructure Dataset" -- for a
        thorough analysis of the dataset's content. The contained microstructures 
        display both local and global diversity. Locally, the microstructures 
        are separated into 10 important classes. Each class is defined by a 
        unique set of local features. Globally, the microstructures' individual 
        features are arranged in a wide diversity of spatial patterns. Mathematically,
        this corresponds to diversity in their 2-point statistics. The website's 
        banner image contains examples microstructures with different local and 
        global characteristics.

        Additionally, each microstructure in the dataset comes with several computed
        properties. Primarily, the microstructures come with several computed 
        mechanical (elastic - Ex, Ey, vxy, vyx, Gxy) and thermal homogenized values 
        (kx, ky). The values are reported for 6 different combinations of 
        constituent properties for the two phases. These leaves a total of 42 
        homogenized properties per microstructure. Additionally, the dataset comes 
        with spatial elastic strain fields for the (1 GPa:1000 GPa) high contrast 
        case. Strain fields are included for two boundary conditions: unaxial tension
        (X) and pure shear. Strain fields for the remaining constituent combinations
        are available from the authors. 
        </p>

        <h4> Storage Format </h4>

        <p class="styled_text">
        The dataset is stored in a HDF file format. We recommend accessing the 
        files using the python package  
        <a href="https://www.h5py.org/">H5py</a>. Once opened, the 
        dataset's microstructures are separated into 10 groups corresponding to
        their classes. The available classes are:
